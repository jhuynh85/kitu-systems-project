## Mike Tyson's Super Hangman Punchout! (React Edition)
by Joseph Huynh

This application a hangman game which consists of a React frontend and a 
Node/Express backend. The frontend displays the graphical interface while the backend
provides the list of available words. API routes are available to retrieve or modify 
the word bank by adding or deleting words.  For the sake of convenience, the word bank is stored
in memory on the backend and not in a database.

Note: Users make guesses by pressing their keyboard keys. As such,
this application is not playable on a mobile device

### Information

React files can be found in the `/src` directory and Node files in the `/server` directory.
Compiled frontend files are stored in the `/dist` directory.

##### Development
Use `npm run dev` to run the application while developing. This will automatically run
the backend server in addition to starting the application in watch mode. In this mode,
any changes to the frontend files will automatically trigger a rebuild. The application
can be accessed at `http://localhost:8080` while in this mode.

serve the application locally using the `node ./server` command. Then navigate to `http://localhost:4000` on
your browser.
